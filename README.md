# CC_Encrypt_AWS

The CC_Encrypt_AWS script is used to convert Rubrik Cloud Clusters on AWS from unencrypted disks to encrypted disks, thus providing encryption at rest for Cloud Cluster in AWS.

## Description

CC_Encrypt_AWS will encrypt both the root disk and the data disks of a freshly launched Rubrik Cloud Cluster. It is not supported to use this script on a bootstrapped Cloud Cluster at this time. The script will take 40 minutes to an hour to run per node. It can be run in parrallel on separate nodes to speed up the proccess. Each iteration of the script will run on a separate AWS instance.

## Prerequisites

- python 3.6.1+ and pip
- boto3

## Installation

1. Install [python 3.6.1 and pip](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/) or higher
2. Install [boto3](https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/quickstart.html)
3. Downlaod and save the [cc_encyrpt_aws](https://github.com/rubrik-devops/cc_encrypt_aws) script from GitHub to a working directory.

## Usage Instructions

To use the script run `python3 cc_encypt_aws.py [options]`. Specify the appopriate options for the instance. These include:

```text
usage: cc_encrypt_aws.py [-h] --instanceid IID --disksize DS
                         [--clientmasterkey CMK] [--profile PROFILE]
                         [--stopinstance] [--dryrun]

Encrypt disks for Rubrik Cloud Cluster in AWS

required arguments:

  --instanceid IID, -i IID
                        AWS Instance ID for Rubrik Cloud Cluster node.
  --disksize DS, -d DS  Disk size for disks in nodes. Minimum 512GiB, Maximum
                        2048 GiB. Default is 1024 days.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --clientmasterkey CMK, -k CMK
                        Customer Master Key to encrypt volumes. If this is not
                        specified the AWS default key is used.
  --profile PROFILE, -p PROFILE
                        AWS Profile to use. If left blank the default profile
                        will be used.
  --stopinstance, -s    Stop instances if they are running.
  --dryrun, -D          Dry run only. Do not encrypt disks. Default is false.
```

## Future

- Add these functions depending on necessity
  - Include capability to run one script and act on a whole cluster.
  - Add ability to encrypt a running bootstrapped cluster.
  - Support use with CloudFormation
- Clean up the code
  - Break out into multiple files to support CloudFormation integration
  - Standardize methods used in the script
